Yet another conscious ape [^1]. I've my *Modern Operating Systems* [[Tanenbaum 2003](https://www.amazon.com/Modern-Operating-Systems-Andrew-Tanenbaum/dp/013359162X)] and *C++ How to Program* [[Deitel 2003](https://www.amazon.com/How-Program-4th-Harvey-Deitel/dp/0130384747/ref=sr_1_3?crid=21ALD0K6QAF4B&keywords=C%2B%2B+How+to+Program&qid=1678283380&s=books&sprefix=c%2B%2B+how+to+program%2Cstripbooks-intl-ship%2C273&sr=1-3)] books from when I was in university as treasures. These drove a nascent curiosity in coding and operating systems that started during high school writing some small programs in Pascal, and led me to work with different Unix and Linux systems over the years. These days I'm fascinated by distributed systems[^2] and cloud computing, I have the opportunity to work with hyper-converged infrastructures and hybrid cloud solutions.

As for what I like to do during my free time, that's long distance running, cycling, reading, and playing around with different ideas, like this blog : ) And somehow always trying to put all this together, to be kind, and do good to people around me.

PXE (Preboot Execution Environment) is a technology used to boot and install operating systems over the network. It enables a client computer to boot from a server on a network before the operating system is loaded on the local hard drive.

By using PXE, organizations can automate the deployment of operating systems to multiple client computers without the need for manual installation from physical media, such as DVDs or USB drives.

1. The client computer is powered on and sends a DHCP discover message to the network to request an IP address.
2. The DHCP server responds with a DHCP offer, providing the client with an IP address, subnet mask, default gateway, and DNS server information. Also provides the location of the PXE server and the boot file to be used.
3. The client sends a DHCP request to the DHCP server, requesting the offered IP address.
4. The DHCP server responds with a DHCP ACK, confirming the assignment of the IP address to the client.
5. The client sends a TFTP request to the PXE server, requesting the network bootstrap program (NBP) which is a small program that initializes the network card and provides basic network services.
6. The PXE server responds with the NBP, which the client executes.
7. The NBP sends a TFTP request to the PXE server, requesting the necessary boot files, such as the operating system kernel and the initial RAM disk (initrd).
8. The PXE server responds with the kernel and initrd files.
9. The client loads the kernel and initrd files into memory and starts the boot process.
10. The operating system boots and the client is ready to use.

# DHCP Broadcast request

The DHCP broadcast request uses the TCP/IP protocol. Specifically, it uses the User Datagram Protocol (UDP) over IP to send broadcast messages to all DHCP servers on the network.

When a client first boots up, it does not yet have an IP address assigned to it (the source IP address in the DHCP client's messages is typically set to 0.0.0.0). In order to obtain an IP address, the client sends a broadcast request using the Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) to resolve the hardware address (MAC address) of the DHCP server on the network. The ARP request is sent using a special hardware address, known as the broadcast address, which is FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF. This address is used to indicate that the request should be broadcast to all devices on the local network.

The ARP request includes the source MAC address of the client and the target IP address of the DHCP server, which is typically set to 255.255.255.255 to indicate a broadcast address. When the DHCP server receives the ARP request, it responds with its own MAC address, allowing the client to establish communication with the server.

The request is encapsulated in a UDP datagram with the source port set to 68 and the destination port set to 67, which are the standard DHCP client and server port numbers, respectively.

Once the client has established communication with the DHCP server, it sends a DHCP discover message to request an IP address assignment. This message includes the client's MAC address, a transaction ID, and other information that the server needs to assign an IP address to the client. The server responds with a DHCP offer message that includes an available IP address and other configuration information. If the client accepts the offer, it sends a DHCP request message to confirm the assignment of the IP address, and the server responds with a DHCP acknowledgement message to confirm the completion of the lease process.

# How does the DHCP provides the location of the PXE server?

When a client computer requests an IP address from a DHCP server, the DHCP server can also provide additional configuration information to the client, including the location of the PXE server.

This is typically done using the "Next Server" or "Boot Server Host Name" option in the DHCP message. When the client requests an IP address from the DHCP server, it includes a "Vendor Class Identifier" (VCI) in the request. This VCI identifies the client as a PXE-enabled device.

The DHCP server then checks to see if it has been configured to provide PXE-related options to the client. If so, it includes the "Next Server" or "Boot Server Host Name" option in the DHCP response, which specifies the IP address or hostname of the PXE server.

When the client receives this information, it contacts the PXE server to download the necessary boot files and begin the boot process.
